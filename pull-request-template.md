# Essential accessibility checks

- [ ] [Site is keyboard accessible](https://accessibility.18f.gov/keyboard/) - all interactions can be accessed with a keyboard

- [ ] [Site is free of keyboard traps](https://accessibility.18f.gov/keyboard/#keyboard-trap) - the keyboard focus is never trapped in a loop

- [ ] [Text has sufficient color contrast](https://accessibility.18f.gov/color/) (a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 with the background)

- [ ] [All content is readable when the page is zoomed in to 400%](https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles/zoom-resizing-text)

- [ ] [No red flags when running WAVE on the page](http://wave.webaim.org/)

For the full list, see [18F's Accessibility Checklist](https://accessibility.18f.gov/checklist/).

All government services need to be compliant with [WCAG 2.1 to AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&levels=aaa). This checklist does not replace an external audit. You still need to test with users and assistive technologies. This checklist just helps you find major issues faster, so you can avoid building on top of them. The sooner you incorporate accessibility, the easier it is!
